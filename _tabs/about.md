My name is Sam Lorenzo, I studied at Utah Valley University with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. I've worked professionally on developing scalable applications using the .NET stack, put together continuous integration & deployment systems and built cloud environments using Azure.

On my spare time, I focus on my health. I've recently been into marathon running, I've ran about 4 so far and plan on upping that number. Aside from an extreme sport, I also like to do anything with some type of board on my feet (surfing, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding, you name it).

This website will be divided in mainly two things, document things I'm learning and putting together projects that use tools that don't exist on my belt. Mostly, it's a space to stay curious and keep building.
