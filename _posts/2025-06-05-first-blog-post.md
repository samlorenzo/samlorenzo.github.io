## Welcome to My Blog
Hey there, I’m Sam Lorenzo, a DevOps engineer who loves building reliable systems, making workflows smoother, and learning new stuff all the time. I started this blog to share what I’ve picked up through real projects and hands on tinkering and hopefully encourage other engineers to do the same.

## Life Outside the Terminal
Tech’s a big part of my world, but it’s not everything. A lot of what keeps me inspired happens far away from the keyboard.

When I’m not knee deep in automation or infrastructure, you’ll probably catch me outside, running (marathons too), surfing, skating, or skiing fresh powder when winter hits. Basically, if there’s a board involved, I’m in.

To unwind, I watch my favorite YouTubers, get into self improvement books, or just enjoy the little things. 

Also, I’m super into personal finance and investing. I think building a future on purpose, whether through work or money goals, really matters.

## More Than Just a Blog
Whether it’s a blog, a personal site, or just a simple write up, sharing your work can be a fun way to learn, grow, and give back to the community. 

I’m hoping this space sparks something for you, maybe just for the fun of it, the learning, or the chance to share your own path with others.

## Today's Win
With every post, I’ll share something I’m proud. Just a little reminder for me and maybe for you that progress doesn’t have to be loud to count.

It helps me stay grateful, stay grounded, and keep going just trying to be a bit better than yesterday.

## Thanks for Stopping By
I’ll be posting updates, sharing projects, and dropping some thoughts, technical and otherwise. I’m all about growing, sharing what I learn, and maybe encouraging someone else to start something of their own.

If anything here clicks with you, feel free to reach out or just say hey.
