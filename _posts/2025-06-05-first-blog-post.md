## Welcome to My Blog
Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Lorenzo â€” a DevOps engineer with a passion for building reliable infrastructure, streamlining development workflows, and always learning something new. I started this blog not only to share what Iâ€™ve learned through real-world projects and hands-on experimentation, but also to encourage other engineers to do the same.

Whether itâ€™s a blog, a personal website, or a simple write-up of a project, putting your work out there can be a fun and rewarding way to gain experience, grow your skills, and give back to the community. My hope is that this space inspires you to start something of your own â€” just for the learning, the joy of building, and the chance to share your journey with others.

Letâ€™s dive in.

## Life Outside the Terminal
Tech is a big part of my life, but thereâ€™s so much more that keeps me inspired and grounded.

When Iâ€™m not working on infrastructure or automation, youâ€™ll probably find me outdoors â€” running long distances (yes, marathons included), catching waves, cruising on a skateboard, or skiing through fresh powder in the winter. Iâ€™ve always loved anything that involves a board under my feet and the freedom that comes with it.

I wind down by watching my favorite YouTubers, soaking in life-improvement books, or just enjoying the simple things: a good meal, a beautiful sunrise, or a quiet sunset. I'm a Cancer through and through â€” reflective, passionate, and drawn to meaningful experiences.

Oh, and Iâ€™ve got a big love for personal finance and investing. I believe in building a future with intention, whether itâ€™s through my career or my financial goals.

## More Than Just a Blog
This site isnâ€™t just a blog â€” itâ€™s also a personal workspace and showcase. Iâ€™m building out a Projects section that highlights side projects Iâ€™ve taken on to help me get hands-on experience with tools and skills that are in demand in todayâ€™s tech landscape.

From experimenting with infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, to deploying cloud-native applications on AWS and Azure, these projects reflect both my curiosity and commitment to staying current in the ever-evolving world of tech.

## Today's Win
Every post, Iâ€™ll share one thing Iâ€™m proud of â€” big or small. Itâ€™s my way of reminding myself (and maybe you, too) that progress isnâ€™t always loud, but itâ€™s always worth celebrating.

ðŸŸ¢ Today, I [insert win here â€” finished a book chapter, went on a long run, fixed a bug, cooked a new meal, pushed through a tough day, etc.]

Acknowledging these moments helps me stay grateful, stay grounded, and keep showing up â€” one day better than yesterday.

## Thanks for Stopping By
If youâ€™ve made it this far, thank you. This space means a lot to me â€” itâ€™s part journal, part portfolio, part creative outlet. Whether youâ€™re here to learn something new, get inspired, or just explore, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re along for the ride.

Iâ€™ll be updating this site with blog posts, project highlights, and more bits of life â€” both technical and personal. My goal is to grow, share that growth, and hopefully inspire someone else to start their own version of this.

If something resonates with you, feel free to reach out, connect, or just say hi.

Hereâ€™s to building, learning, and enjoying the ride â€” one step at a time.

â€” Sam
