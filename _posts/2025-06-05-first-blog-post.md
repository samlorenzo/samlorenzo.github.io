## Welcome to My Blog
I created blog hosting site to demonstrate building and deploying a statuc blog website. Hosted on Github Pages using Github Actions to automate builds, previews and deploys.

## Future Plans
This blog hosting site is temporary for now. I'm currently developing a project that'll be a mainly a portfolio with links to direct you to About Me, Contact Information, Projects, Socials, and Blog.

This project will be my cloud resume. It'll host a resume as a website on AWS with a serverless backend, built using IaC (Infrastructure as Code) and automatically deploying frontend updates.

I also want to familiarize and gain more experience with frontend work. I have a background in backend and infrastructure roles that I feel I want to be more broad. Engineer with many hats, that's what I'll call it.

## Until Then
This blog hosting site was fun to put together. Github Pages and GitHub Actions are great free tools to host a simple blog website.
