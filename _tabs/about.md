I'm a **Software Engineer** with a focus on DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and automation. I enjoy digging into CI/CD systems, building in cloud environments (Azure, AWS), and writing scalable .NET applications. This blog is where I document what I'm learning, break things on purpose, and explore the systems that keep software running. Mostly, it's a space to stay curious and keep building.
