## Welcome to My Blog
Hey there, I’m Sam Lorenzo, a DevOps engineer who loves building reliable systems, making workflows smoother, and learning new stuff all the time. I started this blog to share what I’ve picked up through real projects and hands on tinkering and hopefully encourage other engineers to do the same.

Whether it’s a blog, a personal site, or just a simple write up, sharing your work can be a fun way to learn, grow, and give back to the community. I’m hoping this space sparks something for you, maybe just for the fun of it, the learning, or the chance to share your own path with others.

## Life Outside the Terminal
Tech’s a big part of my world, but it’s not everything. A lot of what keeps me inspired happens far away from the keyboard.

When I’m not knee deep in automation or infrastructure, you’ll probably catch me outside, running (marathons too), surfing, skating, or skiing fresh powder when winter hits. Basically, if there’s a board involved, I’m in.

To unwind, I watch my favorite YouTubers, get into self improvement books, or just enjoy the little things, a good meal, a quiet sunrise, or a chill sunset. 

Also, I’m super into personal finance and investing. I think building a future on purpose, whether through work or money goals, really matters.

## More Than Just a Blog
This isn’t just a blog. It’s a little digital workspace and a place to show what I’m working on. I’m putting together a Projects section to highlight the side stuff I’ve been doing to stay sharp and explore new tools.

From playing around with Terraform to spinning up cloud native apps on AWS and Azure, these projects are all about learning by doing and staying up to speed in a fast moving tech world.

## Today's Win
With every post, I’ll share something I’m proud of no matter the size. Just a little reminder for me and maybe for you that progress doesn’t have to be loud to count.

It helps me stay grateful, stay grounded, and keep going just trying to be a bit better than yesterday.

## Thanks for Stopping By
If you’ve read this far, thank you. This space means a lot to me. It’s part journal, part portfolio, part place to experiment. Whether you’re here to learn something, get inspired, or just browse, I’m glad you stopped by.

I’ll be posting updates, sharing projects, and dropping some thoughts, technical and otherwise. I’m all about growing, sharing what I learn, and maybe encouraging someone else to start something of their own.

If anything here clicks with you, feel free to reach out or just say hey.

Here’s to building cool stuff, learning along the way, and enjoying the ride.
