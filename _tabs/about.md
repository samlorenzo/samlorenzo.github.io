My name is Sam Lorenzo, I studied at Utah Valley University with a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. I've worked professionally on developing scalable applications using the .NET stack, put together continuous integration & deployment systems and built cloud environments using Azure. 

This blog is where I document what I'm learning, break things on purpose, and explore the systems that keep software running. Mostly, it's a space to stay curious and keep building.
